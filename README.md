| Google Analytics Analysis | Using Google Analytics data from a digital publishing platform, I applied Python-based statistical analysis to evaluate the relationship between engaged sessions and user engagement time. This was complemented with content analysis to uncover language and genre distribution insights supporting editorial and growth strategy. | [Analytics Presentation (PDF)](/Digital_Publishing_Analytics_Presentation-MOYO_Thandiwe.pdf) | [Notebook](https://github.com/moyothandiwe/moondancer/blob/main/Statistical_Analysis_of_Google_Analytics.ipynb) | Digital Publishing, SEC | Claude Sonnet 4.5, Google Analytics, Python, Strategy |
| Machine Learning: O-Zone Telecom Analysis | Analyzed 1,470 employee records using advanced machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict employee turnover, enabling data-driven HR intervention to secure workforce stability and support profitable expansion into the African market. | O-Zone Analysis Presentation (PDF) | [Notebook](https://github.com/moyothandiwe/moondancer/blob/main/O_Zone_Telecom%20Python%20File%20MOYO%20Thandiwe%20%20(1).ipynb) | Telecommunications, SEC | Machine Learning, Python, Strategy |
| Machine Learning: Predicting Adult Body Weight | Applied machine learning techniques to predict adult body weight using a high-dimensional dataset of 617 variables. The model supports data-driven decision-making in healthcare, insurance, public health, and digital wellness through improved risk stratification, cost forecasting, and personalized interventions. | Adult Weight Prediction Report (PDF) | [Notebook](https://github.com/moyothandiwe/moondancer/blob/main/Machine_Learning_Project.ipynb) | Healthcare | End-to-End ML Workflow, Python |
